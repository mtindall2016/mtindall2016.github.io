Welcome to my Website, my name is Mariah and this is my first website.

My week has gone ok, being stuck at home isn't too bad. I've had more time with family and i've been able to talk to my friends more.

I actually like being at home more, because it gives me more time to do things I want and not have to rush.

I've had more time to play games with family, and just chill.
