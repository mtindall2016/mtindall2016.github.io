  <h3>About Me</h3>
<p>Hello, I’m Mariah!
  I love to do arts & crafts, so I could help get minds going creative and doing different types of arts including: drama, theatre, cosmetology, drawing, painting, etc.</p>

~Mariah’s Creations is an art studio exploring different types of art styles and careers and is run by the community. Kids can come here after school and get their minds going creative. They can figure out which art they like to do the most and start getting better at it with my help. From folding books to drawing, I can teach them the basics and then they can leave better understanding what to do with that art skill in the long run. It will also keep kids that are in the community out of trouble and keep them busy after a long school day.



~From elementary to high school they can come and learn what types of art they can do and not be held to just doing one specific type. They can explore different options without being binded to just one type and learning to live with it, instead they can do whatever they want. For the budget, the community may need to pitch in since it’s a community run studio. The supplies wouldn’t cost much, because you don’t need expensive materials just to create something.



~Creativity can come along in different ways. You don’t have to be a great artist to be creative. In fact, creativity can come along in a matter of seconds. For instance, why not use legos? This is a great way of gaining creativity. With the art of building, we can all use our imaginations. You may see something that someone else may not. This is just one example of how art is creative at its best.
